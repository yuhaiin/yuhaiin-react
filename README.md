# yuhaiin-react

yuhaiin-react is the Web frontend for yuhaiin. It provides a browser-based interface for managing nodes, subscriptions, inbounds, routing rules, active connections, logs, configuration, and debugging pages.

It is built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, and communicates with the yuhaiin backend through HTTP and JSON APIs. The UI supports light and dark themes and includes optimizations for long-running connection, traffic, and log views.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

## VPN nodes

The node editor supports native OpenVPN outbounds over UDP or TCP, with inline
CA/client certificates, password authentication, tls-auth/tls-crypt, AEAD cipher
selection, rekey and reconnect settings. Connection information is loaded on
demand from an already active tunnel; pushed DNS and routes require separate
yuhaiin configuration. GlobalProtect also exposes the optional ESP/UDP switch
and the active SSL/ESP transport.

These additions require [the companion backend PR](https://github.com/yuhaiin/yuhaiin/pull/508).
The editor does not import `.ovpn` files. Use the server's profile to fill in the
fields, and protect exports/backups containing VPN credentials.

To preview the forms with synthetic API data:

```bash
npm run dev:msw
# Open http://127.0.0.1:5175/?scenario=vpn and choose Outbound.
```
